# Data-analysis-for-HR-data-with-power-BI

## This is new dashboard by Power BI. 
The data used in the project is (HR data) for a company in USA, which includes each employee details like:

### 1- His name and salary
### 2- Social info like (Gender, state - Marital status - Date of birth)
### 3- Hiring date and termination date if he's not an active employee
### 4- His position and works in which department
### 5- His performance score and engagement survey

In the project I have created some measures to ease the visualization process, like a measure to calculate the age of each employee to shows the average ages of the employees. Also I extracted a new (0-1) column to shows if the employee is active or (resigned - terminated)
